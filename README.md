# SucklessAnvils
A Minecraft mod that makes combining enchanted items in an anvil
more straightforward.

Prior work penalty scales linearly, with the increase configurable, and the
level cap on anvil usage is now removed, with an optional clamp value ("Too
expensive" just turns into "Costs <max level>"). Losing incompatible
enchantments also no longer costs extra levels, akin to Bedrock.
